  Abstract                 = {The aim of this section is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research findings concerning the thermohaline circulation of the Mediterranean Sea. The decadal/inter-decadal variability and long-term evolution of the thermohaline properties of the Mediterranean Basin are extensively discussed. We focus on the major climate transient thermohaline events and their links to atmospheric variability and anthropogenic/environmental changes that dramatically changed the deep hydrology and strongly affected the marine ecosystems of the Mediterranean basin during the last 20 years. This section also includes a synthesis of the results of future projections of the thermohaline circulation derived by climate model simulations of the Mediterranean region covering the twenty-first century. The expected effects of the projected thermohaline circulation changes on the marine ecology are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract Two large-scale free-drifting isobaric-floats experiments, “SOFARGOS”/Marine Science and Technology Programme, phase 2 (MAST2) and Mass Transfer and Ecosystem Response (MATER)/MAST3, undertaken in 1994–95 in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea and in 1997–98 in the Algerian Basin, respectively, have revealed for the first time that Western Mediterranean Deep Water, newly formed by deep convection in the Gulf of Lion (the so-called Medoc site), can be advected several hundreds of kilometers away from the formation area by anticyclonic submesoscale coherent vortices (SCVs). This behavior implies that SCVs participate actively in the large-scale thermohaline circulation and deep ventilation of the western Mediterranean Sea. These SCVs are characterized by small radius (∼5 km), very low potential vorticity, high aspect ratio (∼0.1), and extended lifetime (>0.5 yr). },
